# Fibonacci_Sequence_Generator

**Here's how it works:**

Start: The sequence typically starts with 0 and 1.

0, 1
Addition: To get the next number in the sequence, you add the two previous numbers.

0 + 1 = 1
So, the third number is 1.

0, 1, 1
Repeat: You continue this process to generate as many numbers as you want.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
For example, to get the fourth number:

1 + 1 = 2
So, the fourth number is 2.

0, 1, 1, 2

**In mathematical terms, the Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:**
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1, with initial conditions F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.
